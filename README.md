#Stask

Stack your tasks - Stasks is a fast and simple solution to organize your daily to-do's.

Important: Windows only!

Stasks is just another to-do list tool, why USE IT:
* Build for superfast keyboard only use
* System-wide hotkeys to invoke the tool from every window
* Releases focus and gives it back to the window from which Stasks was invoked after interaction is done

Stasks won't interrupt your workflow, it integrates into it.

It is properly tested with Python 2.7

* erase Task ---------: ['Shift', 'Alt', '3'], [Escape] for exit, [w] to navigate up, [s] to navigate down, [Enter] for erase task
* shutdown stasks ----: ['Shift', 'Alt', '0']
